            <h2>EXPERIENCE</h2>
            <h3>Fullstack Developer</h3>
            <p>June 2025 - FUTURE</p>
            <p>My coursework in web development, UX/UI, and information security has provided me with a solid foundation to build dynamic and secure web applications. I have developed projects using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, and have a growing proficiency in both frontend and backend development. I have used Java and C++ in backend and courses like “Big Data with NoSQL Databases” and “Algorithms and Data Structures” have deepened my understanding of data processing and system design, enabling me to create scalable and efficient solutions.
                Hoping to become a fullstack developer in the near future and work with other techniques, languages and frameworks. </p>
